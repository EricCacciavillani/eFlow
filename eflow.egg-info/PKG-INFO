Description: # eflow
        I designed this project to help make my life easier for my data science projects. It uses a combination of generating code in cell blocks (Check my testing/templates for example notebooks) and well designed objects for analysis and modeling. Currently it is far from done; (studying for GRE and have a full time job in my defense: ) ).
        
        This project was mainly designed for and in Jupyter-Lab. I don't know how well it works in Jupyter-Notebook.
        
        # Installation
        ```bash
        $ pip install eflow
        ```
        # Other commands/steps to make the project work properly
        Ensuring the widgets work properly
        ```bash
        $ jupyterlab nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
        $ jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix
        $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        $ jupyter lab clean
        $ jupyter lab build
        ```
        Getting natural language datasets setup. Start by opening up a Python Repl.
        
        ```bash
        $ python
        >>> nltk.download('wordnet')
        >>> nltk.download('words')
        >>> nltk.download('punkt')
        ```
